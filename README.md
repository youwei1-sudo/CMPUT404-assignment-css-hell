Refference 
=================
The original books' HTML from the top book listed in http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top; 
Some cute CSS style, inspired by https://wdexplorer.com/20-examples-beautiful-css-typography-design/, especially for the header theme  
Also, the cute bear wave images from https://www.pinterest.ca/herringwws/bears-waving/.

## In part1:
I wrote a linked css file which is called style.css and this is applied inside the HTML, except for Theme images and image captions with CSS. Thus, i theme paragraphs with CSS,  theme header tags with CSS, theme images and images captions with CSS, change the colour scheme .For all three documents, I added a bear wave image below the books' Preface to show the welcome to Audiences and display captions, with standard figure settings as listed inside the styles.I also wrote comments inside the files. Instead of the full web page (if there are dozens of chapters), My screenshots only contain the major part of the web page(with all significant changes applied).

## In part 2:
The HTML page inspired by https://softwareprocess.es/homepage/index.html, And http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell, The framework coming from the template   https://codepen.io/terf/pen/vgurb
The ugly bear from https://www.deviantart.com/idiosyncratic-hammer/art/ugly-bears-170967550
